# Qt 6 Boilerplate Application

This repository serves as a starting point for creating applications with the Qt 6 framework. It provides a pre-configured setup that works with CMake. This boilerplate is created out of the necessity to avoid the repetitive task of manually setting up a new Qt project. It's designed to save time and effort, letting you focus on the unique aspects of your application.
